				<p>and weathertight Terms used to describe the resistance of a building to the weather. Weathertightness is a state where water is prevented from entering and accumulating behind the cladding in amounts that can cause undue dampness or damage to the building elements.</p>
			</description>
			<commentary title="COMMENT:">The term weathertightness is not necessarily the same as waterproof. However, a weathertight building, even under severe weather conditions, is expected to limit moisture ingress to inconsequential amounts, insufficient to cause undue dampness inside buildings and damage to building elements. Moisture that may occasionally enter is able to harmlessly escape or evaporate. </commentary>

				<p>This Verification Method is for determining compliance with NZBC E2.3.2 of cladding systems and associated window and door junctions only, for buildings of importance Levels 1 or 2 as described in Table 1.1(a) of NZS 3604.</p>
				<p>The tests in this Verification Method shall be undertaken in a test facility with IANZ or equivalent accreditation for testing the weathertightness of claddings to the procedures of AS/NZS 4284, and as used to establish the performance criteria detailed in Paragraph 1.4 Test Procedures.</p>
				<commentary title="COMMENT:">The weathertightness testing of AS/NZS 4284 is modified in this Verification Method for generic domestic-oriented cladding because the Standard was developed primarily for testing specific, non-absorptive facades and curtain wall systems on high-rise commercial buildings.</commentary>

			<section key="1.2" title="Scope">
				<paragraph key="1.2.1">
					<p>The scope of this Verification Method shall be restricted to buildings that:</p>

						<li key="1.2.1.b">have claddings that include a drained and vented cavity of nominal 20 mm minimum depth with minimum ventilation opening of 1000 mm2/m at the foot, including any claddings that require a rigid wall underlay in accordance with Paragraph 9.1.7.2 of E2/AS1, and</li>
						<li key="1.2.1.c">include window and door units that are manufactured to comply with the relevant requirements of NZS 4211, and</li>
						<li key="1.2.1.d">may include buildings based on (a), (b) and (c) above, but with specific engineering design frame elements of at least equivalent stiffness to the framing provisions defined in NZS 3604.</li>

				</paragraph>
			</section>
			<section key="1.3" title="Specimen details">
				<p>The minimum size of the wall cladding specimen to be tested shall be 2.4 m x 2.4 m. Any cladding system within an Extra High wind zone or subject to a specific design wind pressure up to ULS 2500 Pa that relies on this Verification Method shall have a rigid underlay installed in accordance with Paragraph 9.1.7 of E2/AS1. In either of these two circumstances, a rigid underlay is not necessary for the verification tests as a flexible wall underlay may suffice - unless the cladding to be tested specifically includes a rigid underlay as part of the cladding system, and its removal would compromise the structural fixings or support for the cladding.</p>
				<commentary title="COMMENT: ">Testing a cladding with flexible underlay, but then verifying the cladding for use with rigid underlay, is allowed in order to make testing quicker and easier. It is expected that cladding systems with a cavity within the scope of E2/VM1 will perform better with a rigid underlay than with a flexible underlay, although this has not been proven.</commentary>
				<p>For cladding systems intended to be available for use in multiple situations, including cladding systems for which a New Zealand supplier has commissioned the testing for the purposes of providing product assurance, Class 1 or Class 2 testing must be selected. Class 1 and Class 2 each include a mandatory minimum set of details to be included in the specimen. If any of the mandatory details from Class 1 or Class 2 are omitted from the specimen, then E2/VM1 compliance to Class 1 or Class 2 cannot be claimed.</p>

						<li key="1.3.2.a">Test specimens must include vertical and horizontal control joints, internal and external wall junctions, windows and/or doors, a parapet or enclosed balustrade capping with a saddle flashing, a 200 mm diameter pipe penetration, and footer and header termination systems.</li>
						<li key="1.3.2.b">Test specimens may also include other details relevant to the use of the cladding system on the building, such as scupper penetrations, meter boxes, junctions with other cladding systems or building elements, and junctions where roof and enclosed deck terminations, gutters, or other features occur within walls (including within the sides of framed chimneys with cladding).</li>
					</ol>
					<commentary title="COMMENT:">Although only certain details are mandatory for inclusion within test specimens, the inclusion of other additional details could enable manufacturers, suppliers and specifiers who commission tests to demonstrate compliance for a wider range of situations than those which the mandatory details cover. Manufacturers, suppliers and specifiers should ensure that test specimens include all cladding details or junctions for which compliance with this Verification Method is intended to be demonstrated and claimed.</commentary>
					<p>A 15 mm diameter round hole shall be formed in the internal lining below the window to simulate the effect of power points, light switches and other air leakage through the internal lining.

							<li key="1.3.2.1.b">For specimens that do not include a rigid wall underlay, adjacent to critical elements where visual access is required, the wall underlay shall be cut through and removed, or fastened back onto the framing, with a rigid transparent internal lining used to support the air pressure. It is required that between 2% and 100% of the area of the wall underlay (or equivalent) be so removed; or</li>
							<li key="1.3.2.1.c">For specimens that include a flexible or a rigid underlay, small video cameras and/ or borescopes shall be installed within the cavity to provide a clear view of all critical elements where visual access is required. Borescopes and cameras must be positioned clear of all junctions, and must be installed in a manner that does not affect the airtightness of the air barrier (rigid underlay or internal wall lining) or affect the path of any moisture that enters the cavity.</li>
						</ol>
						<commentary title="COMMENT:">The use of borescopes and cameras requires care to achieve these requirements, but may be the most appropriate option in situations such as when other AS/NZS 4284 tests are to be performed on the same specimen, or to help resolve doubts about whether the replacement of a proportion of the lining or underlay with a transparent material will affect the performance of the cladding.</commentary>

			<commentary title="COMMENT:">Analysis of inspection reports from leaking buildings shows that a high incidence of leaks is associated with junctions within, and penetrations through, the building envelope. It also shows serious problems are more commonly associated with claddings that have limited capacity to drain and dry out any water that gets behind them, when a leak occurs. This Acceptable Solution addresses these problems in two ways: a) By providing details for common junctions and penetrations of the building envelope, and b) By classifying buildings within the scope of this document into risk categories, and requiring different cladding solutions depending on the risk score. Using the risk assessment, risk factors can be identified and changes may be made to a design to lower the risk score.</commentary>
			<section key="3.1" title="Establishing the risk">
				<p>A risk assessment of the proposed design shall be carried out using a building envelope risk matrix.

					<commentary title="COMMENT:">Overall the house in this example is still a relatively simple design with a single cladding type. It would be considered to be medium risk in terms of envelope complexity. The lean-to style room on the ground floor is quite simple but does introduce a roof-to-wall intersection which requires the correct flashing and particular care with the kick-out at the west end of the junction. This would make this factor very high risk. The timber deck, itself low risk, connects to the house at the first floor level, and so is considered to be medium risk. Any leaks at the connection points have an opportunity to enter the wall below. The eaves are less than 450 mm wide, and the site is in a High wind zone. The calculations have been done for the south elevation. The other elevations of this building score lower because they are simpler. The west elevation still has the deck connection and scores 7. Cladding options would be the same as for the south face. The east elevation scores 6 and the north elevation scores 5, so these have more cladding options.</commentary>

					<p>The third example illustrates the use of the risk matrix for a complex building.</p>
					<commentary title="COMMENT:">The combination of features present on the south elevation results in a very high risk score. The presence of a parapet at the roof, decks, enclosed balustrade-to- wall junctions and pergola connections all contribute to this risk. The site is in a High wind zone. The risk score is sufficiently high that the south elevation would require specific design, or redesign to lower the risk. Specific design may result in the building consent authority possibly: a) Needing more details to be provided, b) Requiring more inspections during construction, c) Requiring a third party audit of the design. The east and west elevations also score very highly at 18-20, and would require a cladding with a cavity such as vertical profiled steel, masonry veneer or any other cladding with a nominal 20 mm drained cavity. The north elevation scores 14, so would require the use of the same cladding option as the east and west elevations.</commentary>

				<p>COMMENT: C9.7.1 Penetrations should be located where they are sheltered from wind-driven rain - this may be achieved by positioning the penetration in a sheltered location or as high as practical under eaves on the wall.</p>
				<p>9.7.2</p>
				<p>Penetrations less than 200mm wide must meet the requirements of NZS 4298 Clause 2.1.12 and must be sealed all round with a tight-fitting moisture resistant compressible closed cell foam rod or tube that is finished 25 mm behind the wall surface, with the resulting gap filled with:</p>
				<p>i) for unstabilised earth construction, a compatible unstabilised mortar</p>
				<p>ii) for stabilised earth construction, a compatible stabilised mortar.</p>
				<p>COMMENT: C9.7.2 Generally sealants do not adhere well to earthen surfaces with the possible exception of dense stabilised rammed earth or pressed earth brick.</p>
				<p>9.7.3</p>
				<p>Penetrations more than 200mm wide (e.g. meterboxes) must be anchored as required in Clause 9.1 and must meet the following requirements:</p>
				<p>a) Where the depth of the penetration is more than 1/3 of the wall depth, the penetration must incorporate head, jamb and sill details similar to those required for windows.</p>
				<p>b) Where the depth of the penetration is less than 1/3 of the wall depth, the penetration must be sealed all round with a compatible mortar as required by Clause 9.7.2.</p>
