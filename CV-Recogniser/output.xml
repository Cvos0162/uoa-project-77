		<paragraph key="1.2.2">
			<p>Natural ventilation of occupied spaces must be achieved by providing a net openable area of windows or other openings to the outside of no less than 5% of the floor area. The 5% floor area requirement does not apply to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li key="1.2.2.a"> occupied spaces in Commercial and Industrial buildings where products listed in NZBC Clause 64.3.3 are generated (mechanical ventilation of these spaces is required), and</li>

			<p>Openable building elements shall be constructed in a way that allows them to remain fixed in the open position as a means of ventilation during normal occupancy of the building.</p>
			<commentary title="COMMENT">:  1. The net openable area of windows or doors is measured on the face dimensions of the building element concerned.  2. Fixing in an open position of doors and windows used for ventilation is necessary to avoid injury or damage from sudden closure in the event of strong winds or other forces.  3. Keeping water from entering the building must be considered for compliance with NZBC Clause E2 External Moisture.</commentary>
